RSHR: Hierarchical Visual Representation and State-Space Reasoning for Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering

🚀 This repository contains the official implementation of RSHR, a lightweight framework for Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA).
RSHR addresses two key challenges: the visual domain gap in remote sensing imagery and the inefficiency of Transformer-based long-sequence multimodal reasoning.

Overview 📊

RSHR consists of two core components:

HAVRNet 🔨
Hierarchical visual refinement via synergistic spatial and attention modeling for robust semantic representation.

R4SNet ⚙️
State Space Model (SSM)-based multimodal reasoning with linear-time complexity and low memory cost.

Notes 🧩
Upon paper acceptance, the repository will be fully synchronized with the camera-ready version, including detailed instructions, pretrained models, and additional analysis.


Usage 🛠️
git clone https://github.com/xupengfei-dr/RSHR.git
cd RSHR
pip install -r requirements.txt
